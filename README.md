## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git), [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/), [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your Mac or Expo's [app](https://expo.dev/client) installed on your phone, and Node.js(https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)).
From your command line:
